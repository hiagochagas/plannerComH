# plannerComH
This is the first project me and my colleague @helainepontes made using Swift. 
Done in the Apple Developer Academy regular course
Unfortunately, it's all in Portuguese.
This is a Daily Planner through an entire Year.
What it does:
1. Add an activity in a specific day and hour
2. Remove an activity of a specific day
3. Change the name and/or hour of an activity in a specific day
4. Show all the activities in a day, week or month
